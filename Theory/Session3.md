## Q: What is `Polyfill`?
Ans:- A `polyfill`, short for "polymer fill," is a term used in web development to refer to a piece of code that provides modern functionality to older web browsers that do not support certain features or APIs natively. It allows developers to use new and advanced features in their web applications while ensuring backward compatibility with older browsers.

`How polyfills work`:

`Detect feature support`: The polyfill first checks if the browser supports the new feature or API natively. If the feature is supported, the polyfill is not executed, and the browser uses its native implementation.

`Provide fallback behavior`: If the feature is not supported, the polyfill kicks in and provides a fallback implementation using standard web technologies. For example, if a browser does not support the `fetch() API` for making network requests, a polyfill can use `XMLHttpRequest` to achieve a similar effect.

`Enable modern functionality`: By providing a fallback for unsupported features, the polyfill ensures that modern functionality is available in older browsers. This allows developers to write code using the latest web standards without worrying about browser compatibility.

`Progressive Enhancement`: Using polyfills follows the concept of progressive enhancement, where developers start with a basic version of their web application that works in all browsers, including older ones. They then use polyfills to add advanced features and improved user experiences for modern browsers that support those features natively.

## Q: What is `Treeshaking`?
Ans:-`Tree shaking` aims to identify and eliminate this dead code during the build process, so it doesn't end up in the final bundle that gets served to users. This can significantly reduce the size of the JavaScript bundle, resulting in faster load times for the application.

When we run the npm build command, the bundler (e.g., Webpack or Rollup) will automatically perform tree shaking as part of the build process. The bundler's configuration is set up to enable tree shaking by default.

## Q: Every bundler has almost same functionality as parcel, then why it is preffered?
Ans:-Parcel is indeed known for its zero-configuration setup and ease of use. It is a "batteries-included" bundler, meaning it comes with built-in support for many common features and optimizations without requiring explicit configuration. This approach can be very appealing, especially for small to medium-sized projects or for developers who prefer a quick and straightforward setup.

While Parcel is an excellent choice for certain use cases, it's essential to understand that not all bundlers have the same functionality as Parcel, and each bundler has its strengths and weaknesses. Some key points to consider:

`Zero Configuration vs. Configuration`: As mentioned, Parcel's main advantage is its zero-configuration setup. However, other bundlers like Webpack and Rollup offer more extensive configurability, which allows fine-tuning and customization of the bundling process for more complex projects or specific optimization requirements.

`Performance`: Parcel is designed to provide fast and efficient bundling out of the box. Other bundlers like Webpack and Rollup can also be highly performant, especially when correctly configured. With explicit configuration, you have more control over performance optimizations, code splitting, and tree shaking.

`Ecosystem and Community`: Webpack and Rollup have been around for a longer time and have established a large and active community. This means you can find more tutorials, documentation, and third-party plugins for various use cases.

`Integration with Other Tools`: Depending on your project's needs, certain bundlers might integrate better with other tools or frameworks. For example, Webpack is commonly used in the React ecosystem, while Rollup is often chosen for creating libraries or smaller bundles.

`Learning Curve`: Parcel's zero-configuration approach makes it easy to get started quickly. However, learning and understanding the configuration and setup of other bundlers can provide valuable knowledge and flexibility in the long run.

## Q :Is `create react app` uses webpack along with babel ?
Ans:-Yes, `Create React App (CRA)` uses both Webpack and Babel under the hood to bundle and transpile the React code. CRA is a popular tool for quickly setting up a modern React application with minimal configuration. It abstracts away the complex Webpack and Babel configurations, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with build tool configurations.

## Q : Why React App is faster ?
Ans:-React apps are often considered fast due to various factors, including the use of bundlers, efficient virtual DOM reconciliation, and performance optimizations. Let's explore these factors in more detail:

`Bundlers`: Bundlers like Webpack, which is commonly used with React, help optimize the application by bundling all the JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into smaller and more efficient files. Through `tree shaking`, unused code is eliminated from the final bundle, reducing the overall size and improving loading times. Additionally, bundlers enable code splitting, which means that only the necessary parts of the application are loaded initially, allowing for faster initial page loads.

`Virtual DOM`: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. When the state of a React component changes, React creates a virtual representation of the updated UI and compares it to the previous virtual DOM. It calculates the minimal changes required to update the actual DOM, which results in fewer DOM manipulations and reflows, leading to improved performance.

`Just-in-time Rendering`: React's virtual DOM allows for just-in-time rendering. Instead of re-rendering the entire UI every time there is a change, React only updates the parts of the UI that have changed. This approach reduces unnecessary work and enhances performance.

`React Fiber`: React introduced a new reconciliation engine called React Fiber, which is designed to prioritize and schedule rendering updates. Fiber enables React to break down rendering work into smaller chunks and pause or resume work as needed. This approach improves the application's responsiveness and ensures smoother interactions, even on devices with lower resources.

`Performance Optimizations`: React encourages developers to write performant code by providing hooks like` React.memo()`, which can memoize components to prevent unnecessary re-renders. React also offers the` useEffect() hook`, which allows developers to manage side effects efficiently.

`Fast Refresh`: Create React App and other React development setups support Fast Refresh, a feature that preserves component state while automatically updating the UI during development. This eliminates the need for full page reloads and speeds up the development workflow.

`Component Reusability`: React's component-based architecture promotes reusability. Reusable components help reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. Additionally, using reusable components leads to smaller bundle sizes as the same component logic can be used across different parts of the application.

## Q : Why scripts are created in package.json?
Ans:- The "scripts" section in package.json is used to define various command-line scripts that can be executed using the npm run or yarn run commands. These scripts are useful for automating common tasks during development, testing, building, and deployment of the project.
Each script is defined as a key-value pair in the "scripts" section, where the key is the script's name, and the value is the command to be executed when the script is run.

For example, a simple "scripts" section in package.json may look like this:

```json

{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "lint": "eslint src"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "jest": "^27.0.6"
  }
}
```
In this example:

`start`: This script runs the node index.js command, which starts the application.
`test`: This script runs jest to execute the tests for the application.
`build`: This script runs webpack with the --mode production option to build the production version of the application.
`lint`: This script runs eslint to lint the code in the src directory.
To execute these scripts, you can use npm run or yarn run followed by the script name. For example:

```bash

npm run start
npm run test
npm run build
npm run lint
```
## Q : What is Babel ?
Ans:-`Babe`l is a widely-used and popular open-source JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write modern JavaScript code and convert it into an older version of JavaScript that is widely supported by all browsers and environments. It falls under the category of "transpiler" or "source-to-source compiler" because it takes the source code written in one language (modern JavaScript) and translates it into equivalent source code in another language (older JavaScript).

`Key features`:
`ES Compatibility`: Babel enables developers to write code using the latest ECMAScript features, including ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), ES7, ES8, and beyond. This allows developers to take advantage of the latest language features, such as arrow functions, classes, spread operators, destructuring, and more.

`Plugins and Presets`: Babel is highly configurable and extensible. It provides a modular architecture where developers can use various plugins and presets to customize the transformation process. `Plugins` are individual transformations that can be combined to achieve specific transformations, while `presets` are pre-defined sets of plugins designed for specific environments or language versions (e.g., @babel/preset-env).

`Browser Compatibility`: Babel helps developers ensure that their code works across different browsers and environments, even those that do not support the latest JavaScript features. By transpiling modern code into older versions, developers can ensure a consistent and reliable experience for users.

`Build Tools Integration`: Babel can be integrated into various build tools and workflows, such as Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and more. This allows developers to seamlessly incorporate Babel into their development process.

`Polyfills`: Babel can be used in combination with polyfills to provide missing functionality in older browsers. Polyfills are pieces of code that emulate newer JavaScript features in older environments. Babel, along with polyfills, enables developers to use modern APIs while ensuring backward compatibility.

`Syntax Extensions`: Babel supports experimental syntax extensions to JavaScript. This enables developers to use proposed ECMAScript features that are not yet officially part of the language. However, it's important to note that using experimental features may come with compatibility risks, as they might change or be removed in future ECMAScript versions.

`React and JSX`: Babel is commonly used with React to transpile JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which allows developers to write declarative UI components. `Babel converts JSX code into plain JavaScript function calls, making it compatible with all browsers.`

## Q : Explain how babel plugin transform help to remove console.logs,which parcel cant do ?
Ans:-Babel plugins can be used to transform code, and one common use case is to remove console.log statements from the code. By removing console.log statements, you can effectively strip out debugging code from your production build, reducing its size and improving performance.

Parcel, being a zero-configuration bundler, does not perform additional code transformations like removing console.log statements by default. It aims to provide an easy and quick setup for bundling and development without requiring additional configuration.

If you want to remove console.log statements or perform other code transformations in a Parcel-based project, you can use Babel with appropriate plugins and presets to customize the transformation process. This involves creating a .babelrc configuration file or using Babel configuration options in the package.json file to specify the desired plugins and presets.

Here's an example of how you can use Babel with Parcel to remove console.log statements:

- `Install Babel and the necessary plugins:`
```bash
npm install @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev
```
This command installs Babel and the required plugins as development dependencies. Babel's core functionality is provided by @babel/core. The @babel/cli package allows us to use Babel via the command line. @babel/preset-env is a preset that includes transformations for the latest ECMAScript features, and @babel/plugin-transform-remove-console is a plugin used to remove console logs from the code during the build process.

- `Create a .babelrc file in the root of your project with the following content:`
```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"],
  "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-transform-remove-console"]
}
```

- `In your package.json, modify the "scripts" section to include "build" with the babel command:`
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "babel src -d dist && parcel build index.html"
  }
}
```
"build": This script first transpiles the JavaScript code in the src directory to the dist directory using Babel. The -d dist flag tells Babel to output the transpiled code in the dist directory. After transpilation, the script runs parcel build index.html to create an optimized production build. The parcel build command bundles all the assets and optimizes the output for deployment.

- `Now you can build your project using the following command:`
```bash
npm run build
```

This will first run Babel to remove console.log statements from the code in the src directory and output the transformed code to the dist directory. Then, Parcel will bundle the transformed code and other assets for production.

- Keep in mind that removing console.log statements can be useful for production builds, but during development, it's often helpful to keep them for debugging purposes. By using Babel with different configurations for development and production, you can control the behavior of your code transformations accordingly.

## Q : What is the purpose of .babelsrc?
Ans:-The `.babelrc` configuration file is used to customize Babel's behavior when transpiling JavaScript code. It allows you to specify presets and plugins that determine how Babel transforms your code. By configuring `.babelrc`, you can target specific environments, handle browser compatibility, and optimize your code. It provides project-specific configuration separate from build tools, making it easier to switch between different tools.

## Q : What is `key reconcilliation` in React?
Ans:-React's `key reconciliation` refers to the process of efficiently updating the virtual DOM when rendering lists of elements. When rendering lists in React, each element in the list should have a unique "key" prop assigned to it. The key is used to help React identify which elements have changed, been added, or been removed in the list.

## Q :What is `Diffing Algorithm`?
Ans:-The diffing algorithm, also known as the reconciliation algorithm, is a core part of React's Virtual DOM and is responsible for efficiently updating the actual DOM with the changes made to the virtual DOM. It's one of the key reasons React is able to provide a performant and responsive user interface.

When you make changes to the state or props of a React component, React creates a new virtual representation of the component's UI. This virtual representation is called the Virtual DOM. It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM, stored in memory.

Next, React performs a process called `diffing`, where it compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (the one before the changes). It identifies the differences or updates needed between the two virtual representations. This process involves comparing the element tree structure, attributes, and content of the old and new virtual DOMs.

Once the differences are identified, React generates a minimal set of DOM manipulations required to update the actual DOM to reflect the changes. Instead of directly updating the whole DOM, it only modifies the parts that have changed. This minimizes the number of updates and boosts performance significantly.

The diffing algorithm is crucial in ensuring that the updates to the DOM are efficient and that only the necessary changes are applied, leading to better performance and a smoother user experience.

## Q :What `render function` do ?
Ans :- In React, the render function is responsible for creating a virtual representation of the component's UI, which is then used to update the actual DOM.

When a React component is first mounted or its state/props change, the render function is called.
React calls the render method, which creates a new Virtual DOM representation based on the JSX returned from the render function.

## Q :What does React.createElement do?
Ans:-React.createElement is a function provided by React that is used to create React elements, which are lightweight descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. These elements are the building blocks of a React application's UI.

When you call React.createElement, it returns a JavaScript object that represents a React element. This object contains information about the type of element (e.g., a div, a custom component, etc.), its props (properties), and any children elements it may have.

For example, consider the following code:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement("div", { className: "container" }, "Hello, World!");
```
In this code, React.createElement will create a React element representing a div element with the class name "container" and containing the text "Hello, World!". The element object will look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "div",
  "props": {
    "className": "container",
    "children": "Hello, World!"
  }
}
```
After creating the React element, you can use it in your React components to build the UI. React will take care of rendering these elements into the actual DOM as needed, using the diffing and reconciliation process we discussed earlier.

In summary, React.createElement is used to create React elements, which are JavaScript objects that represent the desired UI components and their structure. These elements are then used by React to efficiently update the DOM and render the user interface.

## Q: What is JSX?
Ans:-JSX stands for `JavaScript XML.` It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX provides a more expressive and concise way to describe the structure of user interfaces, especially when working with React.

With JSX, you can define React elements and components using a syntax similar to HTML, making it easier to visualize and understand the UI components you're building. It allows you to mix HTML-like tags and JavaScript expressions together, which makes it seamless to incorporate dynamic data into your UI.

For example, in JSX, you can define a React component like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is a JSX component.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
The JSX code above looks very similar to HTML, but it is actually compiled to plain JavaScript by tools like `Babel` before being executed by the browser. The above code is equivalent to the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return React.createElement('div', null,
    React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!'),
    React.createElement('p', null, 'This is a JSX component.')
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
As you can see, JSX simplifies the process of creating React elements and components, making the code more readable and maintainable. It is a fundamental part of the React ecosystem and is widely used in React applications.

## Q : What is differences between JSX and HTML ?
Ans:-Here's a tabular format presenting the main differences between HTML and JSX:

| Feature                        | HTML                                  | JSX                                    |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Syntax                         | Standard HTML                        | HTML-like syntax within JavaScript     |
| Browser Support                | Supported by all browsers            | Requires transpilation (e.g., Babel)   |
| Single Parent Element          | Not required, can have multiple root elements    | Must return a single parent element   |
| JavaScript Embedding           | Requires `<script>` tags or external JavaScript files | Embedded directly using curly braces {} |
| Self-closing Tags              | Optional to use slash (e.g., `<br>` or `<br />`) | Requires a slash (e.g., `<br />`)       |
| Class and For Attributes       | Use `class` and `for`                  | Use `className` and `htmlFor`             |
| Attribute and Event Naming     | Lowercase (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`) | CamelCase (e.g., `onClick`, `onMouseOver`)|
| Inline Styling                 | Can define styles directly in the opening tag using quotes | Define styles as an object using curly braces {} and pass it inline |
| Support for JavaScript Expressions | Limited to inline JavaScript within attributes or scripts | Full support for embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} |

Note: JSX is specific to React and other libraries/frameworks that support it. It needs to be transpiled into standard JavaScript before it can be executed by browsers, which is typically done using build tools like Babel or Webpack.

## Q :Does Babel comes along with Parcel ?
Ans:-Yes

## Q :Are there two package-lock.json in folder structure of react app?
Ans:-`package-lock.json at the Root Level`:

- This file is generated at the root level of the project when you run npm install or yarn install.
- It is used to lock the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies for the entire project.
- Ensures that all developers working on the project or deploying it get the same versions of packages, avoiding potential version conflicts.
- It guarantees consistency across different environments, making sure that everyone uses the same package versions, regardless of the platform or machine they are working on.
- The root package-lock.json is committed to version control (e.g., Git) to ensure that everyone working on the project has the same dependencies.
  
`package-lock.json Inside node_modules:`

- This file is automatically generated inside the node_modules directory.
- It reflects the exact versions of packages and their dependencies that were installed in the specific environment where npm install or yarn install was executed.
- Its purpose is to provide a detailed and reproducible snapshot of the package tree as it was installed on that particular machine or environment.
- You should not manually edit or modify this file. It is managed by npm or Yarn and updated automatically during package installation.

## Q :Is it possible to put package-lock.json inside .gitignore file?
Ans:-It is possible to put the `package-lock.json` file inside the `.gitignore` file to exclude it from version control. However, it is generally not recommended to do so, and it's considered a bad practice.

The `package-lock.json` file serves an important purpose in ensuring consistent and reproducible installations of dependencies, as explained in the previous response. Excluding it from version control can lead to several issues:

1. `Inconsistent Environments`: If the `package-lock.json` file is not version controlled, different developers or deployment environments may end up with different dependency versions, causing inconsistencies and potential bugs.

2. `Unpredictable Builds`: Without the lock file, the installed dependencies might change over time, making it difficult to reproduce the exact same build in the future.

3.` Dependency Conflicts`: Excluding the lock file may lead to version conflicts, as npm will try to resolve dependency versions from scratch each time `npm install` is run, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

4. `Security Risks`: Without the lock file, there's a chance that someone could maliciously modify dependencies, leading to security vulnerabilities.

The preferred approach is to commit the `package-lock.json` file along with the `package.json` file to version control. This ensures consistency across environments and guarantees that all team members work with the same set of dependencies.

Including the `package-lock.json` file in version control is considered a best practice, and many popular Node.js projects and open-source repositories follow this approach.

## Q :What is `React Element`?
Ans:-A React element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a virtual representation of a UI component in a React application. It is the building block used by React to describe what should be rendered on the screen. React elements are lightweight, immutable, and are not directly tied to the DOM. Instead, they are used to build the virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.

React elements have a specific structure:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement(type, props, children);
```
`type:` The type of the element, which can be either a string representing a DOM element `(e.g., "div", "h1", "span", etc.), `or a reference to a React component.
`props`: An object that contains the properties (props) for the element, such as attributes and event handlers. Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
`children:` The content or children of the element, which can be other React elements, strings, or numbers.

Here's an example of creating a React element using React.createElement:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement("h1", { className: "title" }, "Hello, World!");
```
`<h1>` can be considered a React element. In JSX, when you write an HTML-like tag such as `<h1>`, it gets transpiled into a corresponding React element.

## Q :What is `JSX expression`?
Ans:-JSX expression refers to the usage of JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} inside JSX code. It allows developers to embed dynamic content, values, and JavaScript logic directly into JSX elements.

In JSX, elements that are enclosed within curly braces {} are treated as JavaScript expressions. These expressions are evaluated and their results are used as values in the JSX elements during rendering. This allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive UI components.

Here are some examples of JSX expressions:

`Embedding a JavaScript variable:`
```jsx
const name = "John";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```
In this example, the value of the name variable is inserted into the JSX expression, and the rendered output will be: <h1>Hello, John!</h1>.

`Using JavaScript arithmetic operations:`
```jsx
const x = 10;
const y = 20;
const element = <p>Sum: {x + y}</p>;
```
The expression {x + y} will be evaluated to 30, and the rendered output will be: <p>Sum: 30</p>.

`Conditional rendering using ternary expressions:`
```jsx
const isLoggedIn = true;
const element = <div>{isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome, User!</p> : <p>Please log in.</p>}</div>;
```
In this example, the JSX expression uses a ternary expression to conditionally render different elements based on the value of the isLoggedIn variable.

`Invoking JavaScript functions:`
```jsx
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const element = <p>{greet("Alice")}</p>;
```
The function greet is called with the argument "Alice", and the result will be inserted into the JSX element during rendering.

JSX expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to create dynamic UI components in React. They allow developers to seamlessly combine JavaScript logic and HTML-like syntax, making the code more readable and maintainable. During the build process, JSX expressions are transformed into corresponding React elements using Babel or similar tools.

## Q :Why JSX is considered safe and sanitized for XSS Attack?
Ans:-`XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)` is a security vulnerability that occurs when untrusted data is improperly handled and rendered in a web application, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in a user's browser. 

SX is considered safe and sanitized by default. JSX automatically escapes any content rendered within curly braces {} to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. This means that when you use JSX to render dynamic content, it treats that content as plain text and not executable code.

For example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const userInput = "<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>";

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{userInput}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
Even if userInput contains a script tag as in the example above, it will not be executed as a script. Instead, it will be displayed as plain text in the rendered output, thus preventing any potential XSS attack.
